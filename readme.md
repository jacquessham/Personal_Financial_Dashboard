# Personal Financial Dashboard

## Motivation
Usually a person would have multiple financial statements - bank accounts, credit cards, student loans...etc. Therefore, it is hard to aggregate all the numbers to get a concrete income or expense in every month. The goal is to ingest all the statements and display one's financial situation on a dashboard.

## Requirements
<ul>
	<li>Able to ingest CSV files for the following statements:
		<ul>
			<li>Bank Accounts</li>
			<li>Credit Cards</li>
			<li>Investment Accounts</li>
			<li>Student Loans</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>Display Net Worth</li>
	<li>Display Monthly Gain/Lost</li>
	<li>Display the metrics trend</li>
	<li></li>
</ul>
