# Proof of Concept
The goal of the proof of concept phase is to scratch out how the expected dashboard should look like and observe the details are required to build the dashboard. 

## Data
The proof of concept dashboard will only utilize a limited amount of data - One credit card statement and one checking account statement from Bank of America.
<ul>
	<li>boa_cc_example_raw.csv</li>
	<li>boa_cc_example.csv</li>
	<li>boa_chk_example_raw.csv</li>
	<li>boa_chk_example.csv</li>
</ul>

Note: <i>boa_chk_example.csv</i> and <i>boa_cc_example.csv</i> are the transformed version of <i>boa_chk_example_raw.csv</i> and <i>boa_cc_example_raw.csv</i>

### Data Requirement
